# Vulnerability-Detection-on-Solidity-Contracts-by-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks



THIS PROJECT IS PREPARED AS FINAL PROJECT FOR THE DEGREE OF MASTER OF SCIENCE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF CYBER SECURITY


The original reentrancy dataset has 273 smart contract examples that are labeled as 0 or 1 based on their reentrancy vulnerability status. 


Picked 200 labeled smart contracts. While, 64 of these contracts which are labeled as "1", have reentrancy vulnerability, ,136 of them which are labeled as “0” are not vulnerable.


I divided our dataset into 80% for training and 20% for testing as it is 160 number of contracts for training and 40 number of contracts for test.


Used 4 Layer CNN architecture with word2vec modelin this work. 

These modules are used on this project:

numpy=1.22.3

keras==2.9.0

tensorflow==2.9.1

scipy==1.7.3
