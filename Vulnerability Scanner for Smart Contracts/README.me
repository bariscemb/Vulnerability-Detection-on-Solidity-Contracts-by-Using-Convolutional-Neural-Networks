#THIS PROJECT IS PREPARED AS FINAL PROJECT FOR THE DEGREE OF MASTER OF SCIENCE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF CYBER SECURITY



#We use this dataset for the project: 

https://github.com/Messi-Q/Smart-Contract-Dataset


#The original reentrancy dataset has 273 smart contract examples that are labeled as 0 or 1 based on their reentrancy vulnerability status. 

#We picked 200 labeled smart contracts. While, 64 of these contracts which are labeled as "1", have reentrancy vulnerability, ,136 of them which are labeled as “0” are not vulnerable.

#We divided our dataset into 80% for training and 20% for testing as it is 160 number of contracts for training and 40 number of contracts for test.

#We use 4 Layer CNN model with word2vec in this work.
